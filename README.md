[AD-DINOv3: Enhancing DINOv3 for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Anomaly-Aware Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14084)

We present AD-DINOv3, the first framework to adapt DINOv3 for zero-shot anomaly detection. By introducing lightweight adapters for domain alignment and an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM) that enables interactive calibration between the CLS token and patch tokens, AD-DINOv3 achieves stronger anomaly-aware representations. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art approaches, establishing AD-DINOv3 as a powerful and general ZSAD framework.
